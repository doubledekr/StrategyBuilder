    "strategy_name": "Stochastic Cross Momentum Surge",
    "description": "This strategy combines stochastic crossovers with volume surges to identify entry points during moments of heightened buy/sell pressure, promising significant momentum opportunities.",
    "entry_rules": [
      "Open a long position when the stochastic %K line crosses over the %D line from below 20, paired with a volume spike above its 20-day average by 50%.",
      "Open a short position when the stochastic %K crosses below the %D line from above 80 with similar volume conditions signaling intense selling pressure.",
      "Ensure the overall trend aligns with entry signals by checking a 21-period EMA trend direction."
    ],
    "exit_rules": [
      "Close long positions when stochastic %K dips under the %D line above 80.",
      "Exit short positions as %K crosses over %D below 20.",
      "Set a time-based exit after 5 days of trade initiation if profit target isn't reached."
    ],
    "risk_management": {
      "stop_loss": "Implement a hard stop loss at 3.5% from the entry point.",
      "position_sizing": "Cap position size at 4% per trade for balanced risk exposure."
    },
    "target_stocks": "Mid-cap stocks with sufficient trading volume and prone to significant news-driven movements.",
    "expected_behavior": "Designed to capitalize on sudden market developments, the strategy thrives during uncertain markets, driven by news or earnings. May see suboptimal results in calm, non-volatile settings.",
